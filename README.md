# Employee Management System

 • The Employee Management System (EMS) is a full-stack web application built using Java 17 for the backend, Bootstrap for the frontend, and MySQL as the database.

• It covers basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

• It allows you to manage all employee information in a centralized database where you can check and update and view employee details, and can delete in case employee leaves the company.
 
 • I used live server in this projects to store and retrieve the data  in the database anywhere. 
 
 • I implemented form validation in this project using bootstrap classes and JavaScript.

• I hosted this website on AWS EC2.
